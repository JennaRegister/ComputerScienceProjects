# Computer Science Projects

### These are all of my projects from undergraduate. Ranging from beginner work with for-loops, to Bayesian networks. Important (and recent) projects can be found in the Artifical Intelligence Projects directory. This includes:

* Tic Tac Toe: Adversarial Search and the MiniMax algorithm -> guaranteed not to lose.

* Mastermind: "Guesses" the colors and positions of your "pegs" in the classic Mastermind game, but this time, reversed!

* Simple Bayesian Network (graphical model) with correct posterior calculation given evidence.

* Propositional Logic parser from scratch

### Other Interesting Projects in this Repository:

* Memory Game

* Retirement Calculator

* Postfix Compiler

* Word Search (Hashtables)

### Everything else still needs to be cleaned up because it is a MESS! Various labs, snippets of code, tests, debugging, etc. All from my college undergraduate.
